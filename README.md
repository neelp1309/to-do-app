## Project goals ##
Practicing with JavaScript code for activities that may require comparable reasoning is the aim of this to-do app. 
This was an experiment to experiment with local storage and rearrange the list items based on the filter.

## App description ##
One to-do list among thousands, functions just like any other. Items can be added, marked as "done," or removed. Additionally, you have several tabs that allow you to select which tasks-finished, completed, or incomplete-will be displayed. Additionally, the app stores the tasks in your local storage so that they are still there when you refresh or reopen the website.
